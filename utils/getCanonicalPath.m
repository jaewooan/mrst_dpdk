function [path_string, present] = getCanonicalPath(path_string)
%Get absolute (canonical) path of file in MATLAB and Octave
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   canonical_name = getCanonicalPath('/some/path')
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   path_string - String of potentially non-existent path that may contain
%                 relative indicators in format..
%
% RETURNS:
%   path_string - Best attempt at getting the canonical path.
%
%   present     - Indicator if file is actually present.
