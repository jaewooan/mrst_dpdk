classdef BaseSamplesHM
    % Template class for holding the stochastic samples relevant for all
    % ensemble members in an MRSTEnsemble
    %
    % NOTE:
    %   Not intended for direct use.
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   This class (and its super classes) is used within a MRSTEnsemble
    %   to organize the stochastic component/variables/parameters that
    %   separates the ensemble members.
    %   This base class defines the main API for interacting with such
    %   samples.
