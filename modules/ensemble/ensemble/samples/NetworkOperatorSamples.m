classdef NetworkOperatorSamples < OperatorSamples
    % Class that maps OperatorSamples to a network-type reduced reservoir 
    % model (GPSNet, INSIM, etc). It has the same properties as 
    % OperatorSamples, along with an additional connectionIndices property 
    % that tells us how to map the values from samples.data to the 
    % different connections.
    %
    % The connectionIndices should be a struct containing (either one or
    % both fields) 
    %   - faces: Cell array with the face indices for which to map the
    %            transmissibility values in data{i}.T
    %   - cells: Cell array with the cell indices for which to map the
    %            porevolumes values in data{i}.pv
    properties
