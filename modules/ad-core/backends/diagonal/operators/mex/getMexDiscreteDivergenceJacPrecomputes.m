function out = getMexDiscreteDivergenceJacPrecomputes(model)
%Compute Mapping Primitives for Accelerated Discrete Divergence Operator
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   map = getMexDiscreteDivergenceJacPrecomputes(model)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   model - Discretised physical model including neighbourship information
%
% RETURNS:
%   map - Mapping primitives.  Structure with the following fields:
%           - facePos   - (#cells + 1)-by-1 indirection map into connection
%                         information.  Plays the same role as the field
%                         with the same name in the `grid_structure`.
%
%           - faces     - Zero-based index of cells' connecting interfaces.
%                         The connecting faces of cell 'i' are
%
%                            faces(facePos(i) : facePos(i + 1) - 1)
%
%           - cells     - One-based index of connecting/neighbouring cells.
%                         The connecting/neighbouring cells of cell 'i' are
%
%                            cells(facePos(i) : facePos(i + 1) - 1)
%
%                         Moreover, the 'cells' array encodes the direction
%                         of flow through a sign convention.  In particular
%                         the neigbouring cell index is listed as POSITIVE
%                         if the neighbour is a source of flow INTO cell
%                         'i' and NEGATIVE if the flow is nominally OUT of
%                         cell 'i'.
%
%           - cellIndex - Zero-based non-zero position of diagnoal matrix
%                         element corresponding to each cell.  Integer array
%                         of size #cells-by-1.

%   This function uses SORTROWS.
