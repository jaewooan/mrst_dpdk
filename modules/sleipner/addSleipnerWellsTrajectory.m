function W = addSleipnerWellsTrajectory(G,rock,rate)
% Function to create injection well for Sleipner 2019 benchmark model
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   W = addSleipnerWellsTrajectory(G,rock,rate);
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
%  G        - Finescale Grid of Multilayered Sleipner Benchmark model without
%              caprock cells. Output from getMultiLayerSleipnerGrid.
%
%  rock     - rock structure corresponding to G.
%
%  rate     - Injection rate.  
%
% RETURNS:
%  feederCells - Well structure for well 15_9_A16 from Sleipner 2019 
%                   benchmark model

% where [Dx, Dy, Dz] are the cell dimensions, [Lx, Ly, Lz] is the vector of
% the traversing segment (difference between exit and entry-point) and 
% WIx, WIy and WIz are the well-indices for fully penetrating wells in each 
% coordinate direction
