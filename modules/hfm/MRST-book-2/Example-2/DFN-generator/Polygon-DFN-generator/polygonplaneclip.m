function clippoints=polygonplaneclip(points,planepoint,planedirection,tol)
% 3D polygon vs plane clipping tool. This function takes in the points of a
% polygon (arranged!) in the form of an Nx3 matrix, each row containing xyz
% coordinates of the vertices. The plane is given by a point on the plane
% (row vector) and a plane direction. Take note that polygon points on the
% positive side of the plane are retained. tol is a floating number
% tolerance.
