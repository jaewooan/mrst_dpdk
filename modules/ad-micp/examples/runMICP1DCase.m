% where an injection well will be placed) where the region of interest is
% located, and after the grid becomes coarser towards the right boundary
% (the grid is given as L x 1 m x 1 m).

% when the well is active (dt_on) and a larger one when the well is shut. 
% (dt_off). This is store in the matrix M, where the entries per row are:
% total time of phase injection [s], time step for the simulation schedule
% [s], injection rate [m^3/s], microbial concentration [kg/m^3] 
% (rate-limiting component in the microbial solution), oxygen concentration
% [kg/m^3] (rate-limiting component in the growth solution), and urea 
% concentration [kg/m^3] (rate-limiting component in the cementation
% solution). The injection strategy in this example was set after running 
% simulations and changuing manually the values to aim for permeability 
% reduction c.a. 10 meters from the well; then one could use optimization 
% methods to chose a better strategy.

% the default properties after calling the MICPModel function, e.g., here
% we set stricter values for the tolerances.
