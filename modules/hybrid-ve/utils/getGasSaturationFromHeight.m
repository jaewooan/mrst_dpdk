function sG = getGasSaturationFromHeight(T, t, B, b, h)
    % Internal function: Reconstruct gas saturation from VE assumption
    % T is top of column for each cell, t is top of cells to be
    % reconstructed, with b/B having the same interpretation for the
    % respective cell bottoms. h is the height of the gas plume in each
    % cell.
