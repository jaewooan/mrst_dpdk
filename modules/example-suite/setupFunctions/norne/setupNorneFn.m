function out = setupNorneFn(n)
% Helper function for setting up a simplified Norne model
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   out = setupNorneFn(n)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  This function returns the structure required by the ModelEnsemble class
%  setupFn. This contains the necessary structures to run both flow
%  diagnostics and simulations for ensemble member n of the Egg ensemble.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   n  - the number of the ensemble member required.
%
% RETURNS:
%     out - structure required by ModelEnsemble().
%    
% EXAMPLE:
%   out = setupNorneFn(1);
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `setupNorneRealization`
