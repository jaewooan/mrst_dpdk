function [W] = setupNorneWells(G,rock)
% Helper function to generate a simplified well setup for the Norne model.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [W] = setupNorneWells(G,rock))
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   
%    The reservoir is produced using a set of 6 production wells controlled by
%    bottom-hole pressure and 6 rate-controlled injectors. 
%    For simplicity, all wells are assumed to be vertical and are
%    assigned using the logical (i,j) subindex.
%    Note this well setup is different to the well setup provided in
%    NORNE.GRDECL (as used in showNorne.m).
%
% PARAMETERS:
%    G - grid structure for Norne generated from setupNorneRealization.
%    rock - rock structure for Norne generated from setupNorneRealization.
%
% RETURNS:
%    W - well structure for G and rock.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `setupNorneRealization`, `setupNorneFn`
